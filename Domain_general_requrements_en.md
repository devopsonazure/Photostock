# PhotoStock 

## Description of the domain

You will create a system which is a part of a worldwide portal for trading photos. The portal serves both artists who can sell their photos and graphic designers who buy from them. 

### General requirements
The system should enable the artists to add and manage their photographs in a catalogue by means of web page.
This catalogue should also be available to graphic designers who will use it to pick photos and will place orders via web page.
The process of completing the order may take many days. The system collects charge for the accepted orders in a form of credits deducted from a prepaid account. The account can be topped up via bank transfer. Information regarding transfers is imported from the bank via dedicated API. It is done three times a day.
For fully paid orders the system will issue an invoice and will order the shipment of paper copies of the photos.
Graphic designers are informed about completed shipment of photos by email.
